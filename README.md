# Road Accident Analysis 
# Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard using Excel with Pivot Tables to analyze accident data from 2021 and 2022. The dashboard offers insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) concerning casualty severity, vehicle types involved, and various factors influencing road accidents. The objective is to empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions aimed at improving road safety measures and reducing accident-related casualties.
Data Source: The dataset includes detailed records of road accidents from the years 2021 and 2022. It encompasses information such as the number and severity of casualties, vehicle types involved, accident locations, road types, road surface conditions, and light conditions at the time of the accidents.

# Tools
- Excel: Utilized for data cleaning, processing, and creating Pivot Tables.
- Pivot Tables: Used within Excel to organize and summarize the data for analysis and visualization in the dashboard.
  
# Data Cleaning and processing
- The data cleaning process involves ensuring data accuracy and consistency through steps like removing duplicates, correcting spelling errors, handling missing values, and standardizing formats. 
- Meanwhile, data processing includes adding custom columns like extracting year and month from accident dates for temporal analysis. 
- These steps lay the foundation for generating meaningful insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) necessary for informed decision-making, particularly in improving road safety.
  
# Data Analysis
Develop a pivot table that integrates multiple dimensions, including conditions, vehicle type, severity, month, and year. By employing the calculated fields or items functionality available in the pivot table, key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total casualties, severity-based casualty rates, and temporal trends can be derived.

# Key Findings
Road accident dashboard indicates 417,883 casualties in reporting timeframe. The number of fatal (7,135), severe (59,312), and minor collisions (351,436) increased over last year.
- Car accidents account for 79.8% of fatalities.
- Single-carriageways had the most accidents (309,700), followed by multiple carriageways (26,000).
- Accidents on dry roads are highest (279,445).
- Accidents are higher in rural regions (255,900) than urban areas (103,200).
- The majority of accidents occur during daytime (300,100).

# Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made to improve road safety:
1.	Enhanced Road Safety Measures: Focus on road types and areas with high casualty rates.
2.	Targeted Interventions: Develop strategies for vehicle types that contribute to the majority of casualties.
3.	Seasonal Campaigns: Implement safety campaigns during months with high accident rates.
4.	Infrastructure Improvements: Improve road surfaces and lighting conditions to reduce accident severity.
   
# Limitations
•	The analysis is limited to data from the years 2021 and 2022.
•	The dataset does not include detailed information on external factors such as weather conditions or traffic volume.
